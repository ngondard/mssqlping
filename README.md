## Introduction

This project is for my own education, no warranties provided.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies, contains a distributable [jtds](http://jtds.sourceforge.net/) library.

In VSCode, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
